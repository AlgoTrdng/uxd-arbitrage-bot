# Arbitrage mechanism

- Dynamic position size
  - Lower the size of positions based on transaction without profit and vice versa

# Code

- Refactor bot stages (arbitrage, recorder)
  - Should have ONE entry function, helpers outside of file

- Better names for init functions

# Analytics

- Keep track of price differences before arbitrage happens
